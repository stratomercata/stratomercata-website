# ============================================================================
# Jekyll Collections
# ============================================================================
# Collections organize related content into groups. Each collection creates
# a content type with its own folder, URL structure, and processing rules.
# 
# How Collections Work:
# - Files go in folders named _[collection-name]/ (e.g., _people/, _articles/)
# - Each .md file becomes a webpage with its own URL
# - Collections can be accessed in templates as site.[collection-name]
# - Perfect for content that isn't blog posts but needs organization

collections:
  # Articles Collection (_articles/ folder)
  # Purpose: Platform updates, announcements, and educational content
  # Example files: platform-launch.md, trading-guide.md
  articles:
    output: true  # Generate individual pages for each article
    permalink: /articles/:name/  # URL pattern: /articles/platform-launch/
  
  # People Collection (_people/ folder) 
  # Purpose: Team member profiles and contributor biographies
  # Example files: bob-summerwill.md, victor-wong.md
  people:
    output: true  # Generate individual pages for each person
    permalink: /people/:name/  # URL pattern: /people/bob-summerwill/
  
  # Videos Collection (_videos/ folder)
  # Purpose: Show episodes, contest announcements, and platform demonstrations
  # Example files: strato-mercata-show-2025.10.08.md
  videos:
    output: true  # Generate individual pages for each video
    permalink: /videos/:path/  # URL pattern: /videos/strato-mercata-show-2025.10.08/

# ============================================================================
# Default Front Matter Values
# ============================================================================
# Automatically apply front matter values to files based on their location.
# This saves you from manually adding "layout: person" to every people file.
#
# How Defaults Work:
# - Jekyll checks each file against these scope rules
# - If a file matches the scope, the values are automatically applied
# - Files can still override defaults by specifying their own values
#
# Path-based Targeting:
# - path: "_people" matches any file in the _people/ folder
# - This is simpler than collection-based targeting (type: "people")
# - Both approaches work identically, but path-based is more readable

defaults:
  # Articles get the "article" layout automatically
  # Without this: You'd need "layout: article" in every article file
  # With this: Jekyll adds it automatically to all files in _articles/
  - scope: { path: "_articles" }
    values: { layout: "article" }
  
  # People get the "person" layout automatically  
  # Without this: You'd need "layout: person" in all people files
  # With this: Jekyll adds it automatically to all files in _people/
  - scope: { path: "_people" }
    values: { layout: "person" }
  
  # Videos get the "video" layout automatically
  # Without this: You'd need "layout: video" in every video file
  # With this: Jekyll adds it automatically to all files in _videos/
  - scope: { path: "_videos" }
    values: { layout: "video" }

# ============================================================================
# Jekyll Plugins
# ============================================================================
# Plugins extend Jekyll's functionality. These are automatically loaded
# and provide additional features during site generation.

plugins:
  - jekyll-feed     # Generates RSS/Atom feeds at /feed.xml
  - jekyll-sitemap  # Generates XML sitemap at /sitemap.xml for search engines

# ============================================================================
# How This All Works Together
# ============================================================================
# 1. Collections organize your content into logical groups (people, articles, videos)
# 2. Defaults automatically assign the correct layout to each content type
# 3. Your centralized SEO system (_includes/seo.html) provides different 
#    optimizations for each collection type
# 4. Index pages (people/index.html) loop through collections to display content
# 5. The auto-linking system can cross-reference between collections
# 6. Jekyll builds everything into a static website in the _site/ folder
#
# This architecture lets you:
# - Add new people without specifying layouts
# - Organize content logically
# - Maintain consistent URLs
# - Provide collection-specific features (like different SEO images)
# - Scale to hundreds of content files efficiently
