guests: ["Redwan Meslem"]
description: "The [Tempo](https://tempo.xyz) blockchain was [announced](https://tempo.xyz/launch-announcement) in September 2025.  It is an L1 payments chain backed by a consortium led by [Stripe](https://stripe.com), and is leaching talent from the Ethereum ecosystem, with Dankrad Feist as the [most recent example](https://x.com/dankrad/status/1979133618254405775).  Are permissioned corporate chains back?"
