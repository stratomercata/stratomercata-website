### Introduction and Background

[[0:00]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=0s) **Victor:**
We are live.

[[0:03]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=3s) **Bob:**
Are we live?

[[0:05]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=5s) **Victor:**
We are live, yes. So StreamYard says.

[[0:13]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=13s) **Brian:**
You guys have an intro you like to do?

[[0:17]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=17s) **Bob:**
Yeah, well first... Here we go, here we go. Yeah, there we are.

[[0:23]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=23s) **Victor:**
Go ahead, Bob.

[[0:25]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=25s) **Bob:**
So, hello everybody. I guess we're ready to go. So, today we have a special guest with us.

It's the first time that you and I have met, Brian, but you are very familiar to all of my colleagues here as an ex-Block Apps-er. Yeah, I'm an ex-Crypto X.

[[0:50]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=50s) **Victor:**
You are never an ex-Block Apps-er. You're always like part of Team Block Apps.

[[0:54]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=54s) **Kieren:**
The alumni network.

[[0:56]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=56s) **Victor:**
Yes, exactly.

[[0:56]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=56s) **Brian:**
Yeah, yeah. You guys gave me my first opportunity to work in Ethereum back in 2017, which it feels like ages ago. And I mean, it is ages ago.

[[1:06]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=66s) **Kieren:**
Lifetime, yeah.

[[1:08]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=68s) **Brian:**
Yeah, so thank you guys for that. Happy to be on here. It's always great seeing you guys around.

And so, talking about one of my favorite topics. Welcome. So, yeah.

<a id="what-is-pistachiofi"></a>
### What is PistachioFi?

[[1:17]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=77s) **Bob:**
So, welcome back. Would you like to introduce yourself and talk a little bit about what Pistachio is?

[[1:24]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=84s) **Brian:**
Yeah, sure. So, Brian Smokovich, bsmokes.eth on Twitter. We're building PistachioFi.

It's a mobile-first neobank built entirely on crypto rails, meant to provide premium savings with premium security. And the whole concept of better UX, right? Like, I will get to the question in a moment of, is UX the key to mainstream adoption?

But I wanted to really just build something that, you know, I think self-custody is really important to me and I think really important to a lot of people about why we originally got into the space. But the UX for a lot of these apps was just always so terrible, right? And so, I wanted to be the change that I wanted to see in the world.

And so, decided to just say, screw it. I built my own, you know, basically taught myself UI design in order to kind of begin this in the beginning. And then built it literally by willing Pistachio into existence and many, many, many, many, many iterations of building the app.

And now we're at a point where I feel very blessed that we've been, you know, publicly recognized by many Ethereum talking heads in the sense of being recognized for our UX and what we've been designing and doing and building and doing things in a way to just bring more people onto it.

<a id="shipping-fast-and-user-feedback"></a>
### Shipping Fast and User Feedback

[[2:57]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=177s) **Bob:**
I see that the number you said was 18 versions in five months.

[[3:04]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=184s) **Brian:**
Oh, we've pushed out several since that tweet. Probably at least three or four. So that, yeah, we ship a lot.

We ship, it's a lot of just talking to users and finding what's broken, what's wrong. I'll be at a conference and will literally stand over people's shoulders as they download the app and like watch. And every little tap, right?

Like, oh, the focus is wrong. Like the focus is not beyond the keyboard in this certain, one certain instance or the search is showing the wrong things, you know? And so, every little, that's the thing about UX is you design something and then you build it, right?

And then it's, of course, it's going to be bugged. Everything is always bugged, right? And like we go through rigorous testing to do it.

But then when it goes on to somebody's like very specific use case, because they touch certain things in a certain way and that's what triggered this one bug, or it's on a certain app or a certain operating system or phone, it behaves in a certain way. And then also when you get to see the person use it, you're like, oh, there's a big button there, right? They're going to press it.

They're going to press it. And then they don't press it. And you're like, why?

Why did they not press the very clear call to action that I made? And so, it's just like the only real way, like you can track things through things like Mixpanel and AppsFlyer or would write to see like the UX flows, but you're going to miss all the little details of every single user interaction. And so, just being able to like watch and categorize that and implement that is like a big portion of what I think makes our app more successful.

<a id="web3-ux-vs-fintech"></a>
### Web3 UX Challenges vs FinTech

[[4:35]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=275s) **Kieren:**
Let me ask maybe a slightly controversial question. So, if you think about like FinTech 1.0 companies, I would say they greatly improved the UX on the legacy financial system. Like it looks way better, it works, it's not nearly as much of a mess as the like Schwab interface or what

I think Venmo is a very good example of really, really good UX, but not really being good UI and that UI doesn't necessarily matter so much. Like the UI of Venmo is sort of even like almost antiquated in a way, but the UX is done beautifully. And that reason is because it's like the user, they approach it from just like instead of like a feature, it's just a user problem.

Like what is the user problem? It's like of sending money, right? You open the app, it's got this big send button.

And it's just, it's so simple to just like a few clicks to send money to someone and then withdraw it to their bank. And so like they very much honed in on that very specific UX without even really caring so much about how sexy the UI is, right? And so with Web3 UX, we have an entirely different set of problems that goes very deep just to get to parity with traditional finance and FinTech.

And that's so when it comes to like Web3, for example, especially with Ethereum, it's like, okay, we have gas we have to worry about. We have token approvals we have to worry about. We have multi-chain, which we have to worry about.

We have bundled transactions if there's multiple transactions, right? And so luckily all of these things are now, like there are solutions for these, right? Between like 4337 and 7702, there are ways to implement Paymasters.

There are ways to bundle transactions together. There's ways to do Zaps. Not everyone does all of these things and does it all together.

It's like pistachio pie, we do all of this, right? We do it all together, all in one go. One thing that like we don't do, for example, is like maybe within Web3 gaming, there's this concept of session keys.

And it's like, oh, okay, if I'm going to have a game, do I then have to sign every single transaction for everything that goes that gets written to blockchain? It's like, no, you just do a session key. You sign once as you sign in, basically as you're signing into the game or app, you sign a session key for that extends for that period of your gaming session, right?

And so that basically absolves away or extracts away that problem as well. So there's a lot that it takes for like a Web3 company, again, to get to parity of all these things. There are ways to solve it all.

It's just a matter of like, does the app creator understand all of these things? Are they aware of all these things? Do they care enough to do all of these things, right?

Like some of the major apps or wallets, even like I love, I'm a big Rabi user, they still don't have 7702 implemented, right? And so there's a lot of these like big players that still don't have these available UX implementations live and integrated into their apps.

<a id="from-sales-to-ux-design"></a>
### From Sales to UX Design

[[8:35]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=515s) **Victor:**
I'm curious, Brian, because like, you know, just to reveal some of the background, right? When you were working for us, you were like a sales guy, how did you teach yourself about UX and product design? I'm glad you know, you've joined the dark side.

But it's like, what got you there? And you know, what made you feel like, okay, this is something I can take?

[[8:59]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=539s) **Brian:**
Well, I've always honestly really loved the product side. Like, I think I had like a natural ability to be a salesperson. Like, I love to just chat and create rapport.

And I think that's very important for sales and marketing. But at the end of the day, I really just had a knack for I think it was more of like a just a natural inclination to this sort of thing. And then once I realized it, and I started to do it, it's one of those, it's like the natural calling, right?

Like when you find something that you really like, you don't really know that you really like it until you're doing it and knee deep in it. And then now suddenly, I'm spending 12 to 15 hour days working a website or whatever it is, right? Just because I'm like, I'm obsessed with being able to do this and improve it.

So like, when I was learning UX UI, it was like some courses that I would take and do that. And then a lot of it was just trial and error. And I think a big part of it was having my own thing.

And I'm sure Kieran can, or I mean, I think all of you, both you guys can can relate to this is that once it's yours, you know, there's a different sort of obsession that comes with it rather than just like working for someone. Like when you're you work for someone, it's like, oh, okay, I get equity options and this and a paycheck, and that's nice. That's not as much skin in the game as truly owning something and having being like aligned of like, okay, if I kill this, like, I get monetarily incentivized just because I killed it and it's my baby, right?

So I think that sort of shines a lot in being like a founder and growing your own application. And then it's just like, I have like an obsession with it, to be honest, like I have an obsession of talking to users and understand what makes it better. And just like the perfectionist in me of seeing something wrong and needing to smooth it over.

Right. And so I think all of that has just like, aggregated to and led me to where I am today.

[[11:14]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=674s) **Victor:**
And yeah, I mean, one of the benefits of being in the space so long as we've gotten the chance to work with some great people, and we could always see that you had that sort of entrepreneurial spirit. It's interesting that it's come out of this. You know, I think one little challenging thing about UX for people that come

[[19:12]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1152s) **Victor:**
Yeah, I mean, my kind of theory and one of the challenges Web3 has had is that, you know, in the first phase of Web3, really, we're just trying to solve technical problems, right? Like, make it work at all. And the people who did those things kind of succeeded to a cent.

And then, but those people that can solve like, those super hard technical problems are not the kind of UX people that can kind of think like, oh, from a user perspective, really, right? They're thinking more about, okay, how do we solve that technical problem? And that's really where I think the shift has kind of happened.

And, you know, I think you've got it at the right time.

[[19:51]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1191s) **Brian:**
I think there's a lot more engineers these days, too, that are more savvy in that way, like towards design, like, more like hybrid engineers who have that bat, like back end front, I'm just full stack, right? Who then are now also intrigued in design and this, because maybe they built their own thing from scratch, and they were forced to, right, as opposed to just like a straight up back end engineer, who's doing these things.

[[20:16]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1216s) **Kieren:**
One thing I'll say, I now code again, occasionally, because the AI has gotten so good. And if it has a template, like it's not so good at UX from scratch, but if it has something to work from, I'm like, no, just like generate a component like this and do this. And it usually gets it right within a couple times.

So the iteration cycle is so much less painful than it used to be.

[[20:38]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1238s) **Victor:**
And I found with my web two startups and my mobile startups that like, one of the reasons, you know, I was like CTO of the first startups, and then I switched to product because I realized that like, hey, by turning step three into step one, I could like 10x the usage overnight, right? So it's like that, but it's a totally different mode of thinking than, oh, how am I going to get the code out the door and get all those things?

[[21:05]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1265s) **Brian:**
Also, the infrastructure really didn't exist for a while. Like I remember vividly, like one time we were at the block apps office. And Vic, you said in the office, like, like mobile web three sucks.

Just, just I just I remember, I don't even remember that I just remember you going on about it. And it was true for such a long period of time is that the infrastructure needed to basically bring web three to mobile didn't exist for the longest time. And this last like bear cycle of crypto, a lot of VC funding went to infrastructure, it's still not good enough, but that's fine.

It's already always improving. But the fact that a lot of infrastructure now exists that didn't exist back then, or even just libraries, right of people being of having SDKs that are compatible with react native, or just like native mobile languages, to make it easier for developers to just take that and go and build and integrate. Because we need that, like, I can't, we can't build everything from scratch, dude, like as much as I would love to have everything in house, especially being a mostly bootstrap company is like, no, we need people to have like proper, they need to have like good docs, good SDKs, good API is like hardened stuff that we can just take and use.

And that we don't have to like bash our heads against the wall trying to integrate it because it doesn't work.

[[22:28]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1348s) **Victor:**
I yeah, I kind of remember that conversation. I think one of my frustrations at the time was like, talking to some of the Ethereum devs, and they were like, yeah, we have a mobile solution, we're going to run a node on your phone. Do you know, like battery life is important to me.

[[22:46]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1366s) **Bob:**
This is where I started. Remember?

[[22:51]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1371s) **Victor:**
Yes, we tried to run it on a watch.

[[22:54]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1374s) **Bob:**
When smartwatch, that was my first project was seeing if I could get CPP Ethereum running on a smartwatch. And I didn't that but get worked, get worked on a smartwatch. And it was because it was so early, right, that the chain was quite small, it was kind of just about workable.

And there was a thought at the time, well, you know, yeah, we're gonna have like a light client thing yet, but you know, you get, we'll get that going. And so with on the desktop, right, we missed, you know, missed, missed having embedded. Yeah, it was just a thought that, yeah, you know, it might be a bit slow, but you know, we'll optimize it, we'll get 10x, we'll get 100x.

[[23:34]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1414s) **Victor:**
Yeah, never built a mobile app before.

[[23:39]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1419s) **Bob:**
You're gonna have this stuff, it will just run inside like every router, it will just be like an OS level sort of service. Dude, building a mobile app sucks.

[[23:48]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1428s) **Brian:**
It's hard. It's really hard.

[[23:51]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1431s) **Victor:**
Getting approved by Apple, that's like a nightmare.

[[23:56]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1436s) **Brian:**
I think that was the easy part, dude. It's like, that's hard, but that was the easy part. It's like building a web3 app that's multi-chain on multiple operating systems is just the amount of edge cases that exist is a nightmare.

That's like been the hardest part. Like our last, like we launched in June or like May, June, and then literally all summer was just like hardening the app and discovering and smoothing over edge cases. And I see you've just launched on Android as well.

Congratulations. Thank you. Publicly, at least, you know, we've been like, I'm a big soft launch guy.

If you can, we're always probably soft releasing something ahead of time if you dig hard enough. But yeah, so Android took a while, like months longer than Apple, because it's much easier to develop on Apple, right? It's like everything's standardized, everything just works across every single device.

On Android, it's like, okay, you have to worry about, basically, you have to worry about like optimizations going back far enough to like Android 12 to cover like 90% of use cases. 10% of the world still runs on Android 11 and below, which is almost absurd. And then if you're doing that, you also have to worry about hardware optimizations, right, to make sure that the app itself is lightweight enough to work on like very like base level Android devices, right, because they cost very low.

And most of the world has a lot of these just like really cheap devices. Okay, so you can't like load the app so much, it has to be optimized for that. And then the amount of like different like screen types and like getting the edge to edge display to work via like React Native Expo was also not working very well.

And so a lot of people that launch apps on different devices, right, they maybe don't use React Native Expo, maybe they have like native to each device. And so there's not even like good libraries that help on Expo for this like, like Expo just launched like edge to edge display like two months ago, like, like, like these things still aren't very public. And so my CTO even wants to launch a library, like a publicly available repo just to help with all of these, all these hardships that we had to go through firsthand, essentially.

[[26:19]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1579s) **Victor:**
Yeah, I remember, you know, in my last company, it was a mobile company to make sure things run on iOS. We ran it on two devices in the simulator. We had a table of Android devices, like, and just to kind of like test all the configurations.

[[26:35]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1595s) **Bob:**
But in fact, there's probably, I don't know, 10,000, more than 10,000 different, like, Yeah, I got a couple over here too.

[[26:44]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1604s) **Victor:**
But like, you know, like, TVs and tablets and whatever, right, they're all different. And they're all, I'm really curious, like, you know, when you made that evolution to a founder, as you were talking about before, what, what was the biggest challenge that you faced? Do you think?

[[27:08]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1628s) **Brian:**
The biggest challenge, it evolves over time, right? Like, as I level up as a founder, the challenges get bigger in a way. I think in the early days, one, it was getting people to align with my vision.

It's like, I have this vision in my head. And I can talk about it. But then there's always a disconnect from what someone else's interpretation of my vision is, versus what I have in my head.

And so that's why I learned UX UI design was so I can like, literally just like, put it into a figma and show someone and be like, this is what I want, right? Like, this is how I foresee it. And so that was the first challenge.

And then I got my CTO on board. He's like, I love this idea. Let's do it.

Then we did that. And then the next challenge was the architecture, right? And so then the architectural solution of, of vendor selection, which I was talking to someone early today about this vendor selection is a nightmare.

Like, I luckily already knew what chain I wanted to work on and what like, and how I wanted to be like multi chain. So that was good. And then it's like, okay, so now to be like a robust multi chain application, this is pretty cutting edge technology, especially if I want to use like account abstraction and smart accounts, like very few people are sort of working on this, especially in the mobile era.

And so like, the infrastructure available to us at the time was fairly limited. And then it's like, okay, we have to worry about like, key storage, and how do we do recovery? And how do we keep people safe?

And like, these are all the different vendors, like for all every different, there's a different decision for a different vendor at each part of the stack. And being able to basically understand web three deep enough to understand the trade offs of each different vendor and what they bring and okay, well, what's the price because we're unfunded, right? So I have to make sure it works within my realm of my budget, while also being able to make sure it's like scalable in the long term, if we if we, if we do go into this thing, and then how do we do we do?

Do we do things to be modular? Do we do things to go like purely vertical stack? Does that lock us in as a vendor?

Do we want to be more modular? And, and then we've had opportunity, we've had moments where we've had to just rip vendors out of our stack, because they're not performant enough, they're not elite enough, you know, and so by removing them and upgrading whatever we had, which sets us back in delivery time, right. So which took us a lot longer to build this stuff, especially as like a literally a two person team for the longest time, we just hired our second full time engineer last month.

But like, it's just been me and my CTO for the longest time. And like, thank God that I understand, like, blockchain architecture as deeply as I do, or my CTO would have, it would have been all of this would have been on him. And it made it much easier being able to share that experience.

[[29:49]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1789s) **Victor:**
That's awesome. But yeah, it's, it's a, as you say, every, every step, there's a new challenge. But you know, I think it's also like, just kind of being excited, like you, you work really, really hard, as we can see.

So like, I think it's really exciting to hear about where you've gotten to with this project. And just in Thank you.

<a id="ready-for-the-normies"></a>
### Ready for the Normies?

[[30:11]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1811s) **Bob:**
Yeah. I'm just looking at the time, Brian. So let me just ask you one last question, perhaps.

When? When are we ready for the normies?

[[30:23]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1823s) **Brian:**
We're already ready for the normies. At least pistachio is right. We can we made it so that onboarding is very smooth, very easy.

You don't have to worry about seed phrases, you don't have to worry about even having your phone stolen, right? Like we can recover everything in programmatic ways in secure ways as well, that's not going to get you hacked or thrown to the wolves. And so but at least the next the next wave of updates that we're going to be doing is going to be really cool, too.

I think like, it's just like the ability to essentially the alpha is like the ability to send bank transfers from an on chain account, like to to specific chain accounts all over the world for very, very cheap. So like stuff like that is going to be really cool, because that solves real pain, right? It's like this idea of going back to before literally what I've been talking about.

Like crypto and even to tie it all in for the is better web three UX, the key to mainstream adoption, and I don't think it is right. It's like, better UX is the key to any app adoption, right? It's why we've seen Robin Hood or whatever get big, but there needs to be a fundamental problem and fundamental pain being solved at the end of the day.

And if our ability if my ability to send an on chain transaction, and have it arrive as an ACH transfer or a spade transfer from the US to Mexico for only a dollar, like, that's that's significant pain being solved. Because like most common applications right now that do it, or let's say like dollar app or Felix, and they do it for like a $3 flat fee, which is still pretty expensive for considering if you want to send money to someone, if you only want to send in small amounts, right, it's like $100. That's a 3% fee that's quite high.

And so we can basically do it in a way with like no limits, no caps, you can send $50,000 for for a dollar if you want to do it like with banking rails, or if you want to just keep it on chain and keep it in pistachio, right, it's it's free, unlimited, as we all know how you can like send money and in crypto land, right, you can send a million dollars in a second for for only a few cents and on pistachio every all the peer to peer transactions are free.

So I think we're ready for normies right now. But it's just about increasing the amount of increasing the the use cases within the app to very soft to solve very distinct pains. Painful.

Expensive pains. That's the way to do it. Okay, well, thank you very much.

Thank you guys for having me. Yeah, I know you got a got a run.
