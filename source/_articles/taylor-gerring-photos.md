*GM! 8 years ago today, I arrived at the Miami house rented by Decentral. Since I showed up unannounced and there were no more beds, my only choice was to sleep under the stars. I don't know anyone, don't have a car, and don't know what I'm there to do.* - 25th January 2014

*8 years ago today, #Ethereum was formally announced in Miami. After a standing-room only talk and extended line of questions, we all shuffled into a hallway to make room for the next speaker. Joe Lubin and Anthony Di Iorio can be seen next to [Vitalik]('/people/vitalik-buterin/') as the crowd encroaches* - 26th January 2014

*8 years ago tonight was my last day as a typical Chicagoan. Taken at The Green Lady, I would get far too little sleep for my early flight the next morning.
