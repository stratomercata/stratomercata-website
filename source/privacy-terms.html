<p><strong>Last Updated: October 27, 2025</strong></p>

<p>This Privacy Policy describes the policies and procedures of STRATO Mercata, Inc, a BVI company registered under the number 2179057, ("we," "our," "us", or "STRATO Mercata") on the collection, use, recordation, and disclosure of your information when you (i) sign up to use a STRATO Mercata account or service through https://www.stratomercata.com, the services, features, content, applications, and application protocol interfaces ("STRATO Mercata APIs"), or the STRATO Mercata mobile application products and related services we offer (collectively referred to as the "STRATO Mercata Site"); or (ii) record a transaction on the STRATO Mercata blockchain provided by STRATO Mercata in the course of using one of the STRATO Mercata Products referenced herein; or (iii) such other services that may be offered by STRATO Mercata from time to time (collectively (i), (ii) or (iii) shall be referred to as "Services"). Your use of the Services is subject to this Policy as well as our Terms of Service.</p>

<p>This Privacy Policy does not apply to third-party websites, products, or services, even if we provide links to them or them to us.</p>

<h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>

<p>We occasionally review this Privacy Policy to make sure it complies with applicable laws and conforms to changes in our business. We may need to update this Privacy Policy, and we reserve the right to do so at any time. If we do revise this Privacy Policy, we will update the "Last Date Updated" at the top of this page so that you can tell if it has changed since your last visit. Please review this Privacy Policy regularly to ensure that you are aware of its terms. Any use of STRATO Mercata after an amendment to our Privacy Policy constitutes your acceptance to the revised or amended agreement.</p>

<h2>How You Accept This Policy</h2>

<p>By accessing or using the Services, signing up to use a STRATO Mercata account or service through stratomercata.com, STRATO Mercata's APIs, or the STRATO Mercata mobile application, entering into an order form to use a STRATO Mercata Product, requesting to join our mailing list, or signing up for a demo, you agree to the use, disclosure, and procedures outlined in this Privacy Policy.</p>

<p>If you do not agree with or are not comfortable with our Privacy Policy, you should immediately stop access or use of our Services.</p>

<h2>Information Collect and Use</h2>

<p>The information we collect from you falls into two categories: (i) personally identifiable information that you share with us (i.e., data that could potentially identify you as an individual) ("Personal Information"), and (ii) non-personally identifiable information (i.e., information that cannot be used to identify who you are) ("Non-Personal Information"). This Privacy Policy covers both categories and will tell you how we might collect and use each type.</p>

<p>We use the data we collect in accordance with your instructions, including any applicable terms in our Terms of Service, and as required by law. We primarily use the information we collect and store (i) to provide you with an efficient, secure, and smooth user experience and to create, develop, deliver, and enhance the Services, content and advertising; (ii) for harm or loss prevention; (iii) for anti-fraud purposes; (iv) for enforcement of our agreements and policies; (v) to maintain legal and regulatory compliance; (vi) to comply with our legal obligations; and (vii) to protect the rights, property, or safety of STRATO Mercata, our employees, our users, or others.</p>

<p>Except if we sell all or a portion of our business, or as otherwise described below, we do not rent, trade, or sell your Personal Information. If we (or our assets) are acquired, or if we go out of business, enter bankruptcy, or go through some other change of control, your Personal Information could be one of the assets transferred to or acquired by a third party. By accepting this Privacy Policy, you consent to any such transfer.</p>

<h2>Personal Information</h2>

<p>When you interact with us through the STRATO Mercata site, request a demo, participate in a questionnaire/study, sign up for our Services or our mailing list, or contact us with inquires through phone, email, Twitter, Discord, Telegram, instant message, live chat, social media, or any other support channel, you may voluntarily provide us with your Personal Information (i.e. your name, email, address, telephone number, job title, etc.). By voluntarily providing us with Personal Information, you are consenting to our use and storage of it in accordance with this Privacy Policy and you acknowledge and agree that such Personal Information may be transferred from your current location to the offices and servers of the Company and the authorized third parties referred to herein some of whom are located in the United States.</p>

<p>You do not need to provide us with any personal data to use the Services.</p>

<h2>Non-Personal Information</h2>

<p>We may also collect a variety of Non-Personal Information, including analytics data including: (i) the IP address of the computer you use to access the Services; (ii) the type of browser software you are using; (iii) the operating system you are using; (iv) the date and time you access or use the Services; (v) the website address, if any, that linked you to our Services; (vi) the website address, if any, you leave our website and travel to; (vii) mobile deviceID; and (viii) other non-personally identifiable traffic data to provide and personalize the Services and features of the Services for you across sessions. For example, we may use this information to remember your (i) token purchases; (ii) favorites; or (iii) track record. These analytics may also be used in the aggregate for (i) improving and growing STRATO Mercata; (ii) for business, statistical, or other pattern analysis; and (iii) operations purposes; (iv) business intelligence; (v) product development; (vi) responding to users' support requests; and (vii) improving products and services. Aggregated data includes user data reflecting or based on the access or use of the STRATO Mercata Products, platform visits, session, impression and clickstream data that is automatically collected, aggregated and anonymized by STRATO Mercata Products. STRATO Mercata may also use third parties, such as Flurry, in order to develop and analyze use of the Services.</p>

<p>Like most websites, STRATO Mercata may incorporate technology such as "pixel tags," "web beacons," and "cookies" to help identify and track usage of the Services and to make it easier to deliver a personalized experience. Pixel tags or web beacons are tracking devices on websites or in emails that can monitor the behavior of the user visiting the website or sending the e-mail. Cookies (not to be confused with the sugary treat) are small files that web servers may place on your computer when you visit a website. You can easily refuse our cookies by adjusting the preferences in your browser. However, be forewarned that disabling cookies may cause STRATO Mercata to not operate properly.</p>

<h2>Public Blockchain Data and Wallet Address</h2>

<p>When you connect your non-custodial blockchain wallet to the Services, we collect and log your publicly available blockchain address to learn more about your use of the Services and may ourselves or through a third-party provider screen your wallet using specialized blockchain analytics and risk-scoring tools to determine any prior illicit activity. Because blockchain addresses are publicly available data that are not created or assigned by us or any central party, by themselves they are not personally identifying.</p>

<h2>Third Party Services</h2>

<p>We haven't built all the features offered on our Services from scratch. To run the Services, we often utilize various third-party products (collectively "Third Party Services"), including, but not limited to AWS Cloud to create an instance of our blockchain solution on STRATO Mercata, blockchain data providers and analyzers, technical infrastructure service providers, and advertising networks and analytics providers to assist us in providing, delivering, and improving the Services.</p>

<h2>Third Party Cookies</h2>

<p>We use services provided by Google and other third parties that use tracking technology such as cookies, deviceID, and localStorage, to collect information about your use of the Services and our interactions with you. You can opt out of having your online activity and device data collected through these third-party services by changing your device settings, using privacy plug-ins or browsers, or using advertising industry opt-out tools.</p>

<h2>Third-Party Links and Sites</h2>

<p>We may integrate technologies operated or controlled by other parties into parts of the Services. For example, the Services may include links that hyperlink to websites, platforms, and other services not operated or controlled by us. Please note that when you interact with these other parties, including when you leave our site, those parties may independently collect information about you and solicit information from you and your use of these third-party services is governed by their respective Terms of Service and Privacy Policies. You can learn more about how those parties collect and use your data by consulting their privacy policies and other terms. We have no control over, and assume no responsibility for the accuracy, authenticity, content, privacy policies or practices of any third-party sites, products or services linked.</p>

<h2>User Rights of California, Colorado, Connecticut, Utah and Virginia Residents</h2>

<p>The California Consumer Privacy Act ("CCPA") and the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 ("CPRA"), plus the Colorado Privacy Act ("CPA"), Connecticut Data Privacy Act ("CDPA"), Utah Consumer Privacy Act ("UCPA") and Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act ("VCDPA") allow consumers in these states to opt out of certain sharing of their data.</p>

<p>As such, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Utah and Virginia residents may request that STRATO Mercata: (i) Disclose the sources, categories, and specific pieces of personal information we have collected about them, how that information is used, and with whom STRATO Mercata shares it; (ii) Disclose the purpose for collecting personal information; (iii) Disclose the categories of third parties with whom STRATO Mercata shares personal information; (iv) Delete/rectify/restrict their personal information, subject to certain exceptions (right of rectification not applicable to Utah residents); (v) Disclose, for any "sales" of personal information, the categories of personal information collected and sold and to what categories of third parties it was sold; (vi) Opt them out of sales of their personal information (if any) or subject certain personal information to automated decision-making algorithms (not applicable to Utah residents); (vii) Provide a copy of their personal information in a readily usable format that allows the information to be transmitted to others; and (viii) Residents in these states may not be discriminated against for exercising any of the rights described above.</p>

<p>California, Colorado, Connecticut, Utah and Virginia residents may exercise these rights by contacting STRATO Mercata at info@stratomercata.com. If you request that your information be deleted, we still may retain some Personal Information that you have provided to us in order to preserve our legal rights, continue performing our obligations, or comply with relevant laws. Additionally, we cannot edit or delete information such as your blockchain wallet address, transaction data, and any assets held by your wallet address. If the data you provided to us was for processing on a blockchain service such as ours and is necessary for the performance of a contract on the blockchain to which you are a party or to the performance of pre-contractual measures adopted at your request, your data will not be deleted as long as it is necessary in view of the purpose for which it was collected. We may also retain depersonalized information after deletion.</p>

<p>We are legally obligated to verify your identity when you submit a request; thus, we may request additional information from you, like your date of birth or a personal identification number, to verify your identity. If we cannot verify your identity, we may deny your request.</p>

<h2>Data Security</h2>

<p>We follow generally accepted industry standards and take reasonable measures to help protect the information we collect from loss, theft, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction. Even with all these precautions, transmission via the internet is not completely secure, and we cannot guarantee against the access, disclosure, alteration, misuse, or deletion of data through events, including but not limited to hardware or software failure or unauthorized use. Any information that you provide to us is done so entirely at your own risk. You are responsible for all of your activity on the Services, including the security of your blockchain network addresses, cryptocurrency wallets, and their cryptographic keys.</p>

<h2>Children</h2>

<p>We are especially sensitive about children's information. We're not a site targeted towards children, and we don't knowingly collect personal information (as defined by the U.S. Children's Privacy Protection Act, or "COPPA") from children under the age of 18. If you are a parent or legal guardian of a minor child, we will treat any information that you provide us while using STRATO Mercata on behalf of your minor child as Personal Information as otherwise provided in this Privacy Policy. If we suspect that the user submitting personal information is younger that 18 years of age, we will require that user to close his/her account and will not allow the user to continue using our Services. If you have questions concerning our information practices with respect to children, or if you learn that a child under the age of 18 has used STRATO Mercata, created a user account, or provided us with personal information, please email us at info@stratomercata.com.</p>

<h2>Online Tracking and How We Respond to Do Not Track Signals</h2>

<p>Online tracking is the collection of data about an individual's Internet activity used to deliver targeted advertisements and for other purposes. Some web browsers (including Safari, Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Chrome) incorporate a "Do Not Track" (DNT) or similar feature that signals to websites that a visitor does not want to have his/her online activity and behavior tracked. If an online service elects to respond to a particular DNT signal, the service may refrain from collecting certain personal information about the browser's user. Not all browsers offer a DNT option and there is currently no industry consensus as to what constitutes a DNT signal. For these reasons, many website operators, including STRATO Mercata, do not take action to respond to DNT signals. For more information about DNT signals, visit http://allaboutdnt.com.</p>

<h2>International Users and Visitors</h2>

<p>STRATO Mercata is hosted in the United States but operates globally. Because the Internet is global, you should note that by providing Personal Information as an international visitor or user, you are: (i) permitting the transfer of your Personal Information to, and storage in, the United States, which may not have the same data protection laws as the country in which you reside; and (ii) permitting the use of your Personal Information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>

<p>STRATO Mercata protects your personal data in accordance with this Privacy Policy wherever it is processed and take appropriate contractual or other steps to protect it under applicable laws.</p>

<h2>EU Users' Rights</h2>

<p>In addition to other rights detailed in the policy, EU citizens have certain rights regarding your personal information, including the right to: (i) request access and obtain a copy of your personal data; (ii) request rectification or erasure of your personal data; (iii) object to or restrict the processing of your personal data; and (iv) request portability of your personal data. Additionally, you may withdraw your consent to our collection at any time. To exercise these rights, you can send us a request by emailing at info@stratomercata.com and we will make a reasonable effort to comply within a reasonable period of time as long as we are not obligated to preserve your information due to things like law enforcement preservation requests, subpoenas, investigations, litigation, or otherwise meet any of our other legal obligation and preserve and enforce our legal rights. However, we cannot edit or delete information such as your blockchain wallet address, transaction data, and any assets held by your wallet address. If the data you provided to us was for processing on a blockchain service such as ours and is necessary for the performance of a contract on the blockchain to which you are a party or to the performance of pre-contractual measures adopted at your request, your data will not be deleted as long as it is necessary in view of the purpose for which it was collected. We may also retain depersonalized information after deletion.</p>
