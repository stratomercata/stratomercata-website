STRATO Mercata is reimagining how users interact with real-world assets by combining the familiarity of gold and silver with the speed and utility of a decentralized financial system. As the first Layer 1 blockchain purpose-built for vault-backed tokenization, STRATO Mercata simplifies depositing, staking, borrowing, and redeeming physical assets. Now, with the launch of the Mercata Rewards Program, each of these actions earns CATA Points. These points grant access to the upcoming CATA governance token, enabling users to influence platform direction and deepen their engagement with tokenized assets.

## Revolutionizing Real-World Asset Tokenization with Blockchain Technology

STRATO Mercata is reimagining how users interact with real-world assets by combining the familiarity of gold and silver with the speed and utility of a decentralized financial system. As the first Layer 1 blockchain purpose-built for vault-backed tokenization, STRATO Mercata simplifies depositing, staking, borrowing, and redeeming physical assets.

## How to Earn CATA Points: Seamless Integration Across All Platform Activities

### Automatic Point Earning Activities

The rewards program is seamlessly integrated into the product. When you deposit GOLDST or SILVST, bridge crypto into the network, or stake assets for instant credit, you automatically earn CATA Points. First-time borrowing, diversifying into new asset classes, and referring others to participate also accrue points.

### Streamlined User Experience

The user experience is intuitive: activities ranging from purchasing with USDST—our platform-native stablecoin—to redeeming physical gold via our vault partners have been streamlined to encourage meaningful participation rather than mere speculation.

## Security and Transparency: 1:1 Asset Backing with Smart Contract Protection

### Uncompromising Security Framework

This system's strength lies in its uncompromising approach to security and transparency. STRATO Mercata employs smart contracts and regular third-party audits to ensure that vaulted assets, such as gold, remain consistently backed at a 1:1 ratio.

### Inclusive Global Access

Whether you're a seasoned crypto enthusiast or exploring digital gold for the first time, you'll benefit from transparent asset pricing, robust identity verification controls, and a globally inclusive user experience—especially valuable for those relying on informal financial tools or "mattress savings."

## CATA Token Governance: Shape the Future of Decentralized Asset Management

### Beyond Rewards: Powerful Governance Rights

The CATA token extends beyond mere rewards; it serves as a powerful governance instrument. CATA holders can influence borrowing rates, system fees, and network upgrades, directly shaping the future of this hybrid financial infrastructure.

### Your Gateway to Active Participation

With Mercata, you aren't just earning points; you're actively participating in a platform merging the permanence of precious metals with DeFi's flexibility. The rewards program is your gateway to this ecosystem. Start earning, start governing, and start creating tangible value with every tokenized move.
