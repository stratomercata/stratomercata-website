Available pairs include:

- Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC)
- Ethereum (ETH)
- [Backed S&P 500](https://backed.fi/news-updates/introducing-bcspx) (bCSPXST)

Swaps update your portfolio and can be used as collateral for borrowing.

### Borrow Against Collateral

Supply assets to increase your borrowing power, then borrow additional USDST or other assets. Your borrowing risk level, available borrowing power, and interest rate are all displayed in the Portfolio Overview.

## Strategies to Try

- **Leverage Borrowing**: Use RWAs as collateral to borrow and expand your position.
- **Diversify Pools**: Split your assets across lending and swap pools to maximize simulated APY.
- **Monitor Risk**: Keep your borrowing risk level within safe limits to avoid liquidation.
