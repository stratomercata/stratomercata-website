## Introduction

Good things come to those who wait.

It's been a long wait, we know, but it's finally here.  Tomorrow we will be releasing [STRATO Mercata V2](https://app.stratomercata.com/) to the world.

What's new? For end-users, absolutely everything.  It's a complete ground-up rebuild for the application.  Participants in our [July](/blog/announcing-mercata-v2-trading-competition/) and [September](/blog/announcing-mercata-v2-testing-challenge/) competitions got a sneak peek, but this will be fresh for everybody else.  Existing accounts and balances will be carried forward into the new application.

The switchover will be tomorrow, Wednesday 29th October, 2025 at 10am ET (hopefully without <i>too much</i> downtime).<br/>
We will be doing a walkthrough of the new application on our [weekly Spaces at 5pm ET](/videos/mercata-v2-launch/).

Expect a steady drip of blog posts, documentation and videos from here on out.

The underlying technology platform, [STRATO](https://docs.stratomercata.com/), also underwent fairly significant changes to support the new functionality and to remove some remaining enterprise blockchain baggage. We will be open-sourcing our entire tech stack in November, all 31,000 commits of it.  The initial Haskell codebase goes back to [September 2014](https://github.com/jamshidh/ethereum-client-haskell/commit/60d4cadb9ebde7b126b80079dede5ca0d5604a99), nearly a year before the Ethereum mainnet [was launched](https://blog.ethereum.org/2015/07/30/ethereum-launches).

The code has just undergone an external security audit, and the results of that audit will be made public on a similar timeline to the [open-source release](https://github.com/stratomercata).

**If you have any questions or hit any issues during this process, please [contact us](/contact/) in whatever way works best for you.  The [Telegram](https://t.me/stratomercata) channel is likely to be the most responsive.**

Validator rewards and the CATA Points program will be paused during the transition.
