## Introduction

Good things come to those who wait.

It's been a long wait, we know, but it's finally here.  We are releasing [STRATO Mercata V2](https://app.stratomercata.com/) to the world.

What's new? For end-users, absolutely everything.  It's a complete ground-up rebuild of the application.  Participants in our [July](/blog/announcing-mercata-v2-trading-competition/) and [September](/blog/announcing-mercata-v2-testing-challenge/) competitions got a sneak peek, but this will be fresh for everybody else.  Existing accounts and balances will carry forward into the new application.

<div class="highlight-yellow">
The switchover will happen shortly (hopefully without <i>too much</i> downtime).<br/>
We will send out a message on our primary channels confirming when V2 is live.<br/>
We will be doing a walkthrough of the new application in an upcoming Spaces.<br/>
<br/>
<b>
Update: So the switchover was completed late that evening.
</b>
</div>

Expect a steady drip of blog posts, documentation and videos from here on out.

The code has just undergone an external security audit, and we'll make the results public in the near future.

**If you have any questions or run into any issues during the transition, please [contact us](/contact/) in whatever way works best for you.  The [Telegram](https://t.me/stratomercata) channel will likely be the most responsive.**

Validator rewards and the CATA Points program will pause during the transition.
