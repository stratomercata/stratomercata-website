## Introduction

Good things come to those who wait.

It's been a long wait, we know, but it's finally here.  We are releasing [STRATO Mercata V2](https://app.stratomercata.com/) to the world.

What's new? For end-users, absolutely everything.  It's a complete ground-up rebuild of the application.  Participants in our [July](/blog/announcing-mercata-v2-trading-competition/) and [September](/blog/announcing-mercata-v2-testing-challenge/) competitions got a sneak peek, but this will be fresh for everybody else.  Existing accounts and balances will carry forward into the new application.

The switchover will happen shortly (hopefully without <i>too much</i> downtime).<br/>
We will send out a message on our primary channels confirming when V2 is live.<br/>
We will be doing a walkthrough of the new application in an upcoming Spaces.

Expect a steady drip of blog posts, documentation and videos from here on out.

The underlying technology platform, [STRATO](https://docs.stratomercata.com/), also underwent fairly significant changes to support the new functionality and remove some remaining enterprise blockchain baggage. We'll open-source our entire tech stack in November - all 31,000 commits of it.  The initial Haskell codebase dates back to [September 2014](https://github.com/jamshidh/ethereum-client-haskell/commit/60d4cadb9ebde7b126b80079dede5ca0d5604a99), nearly a year before the Ethereum mainnet [was launched](https://blog.ethereum.org/2015/07/30/ethereum-launches).

The code has just undergone an external security audit, and we'll make the results public on a similar timeline to the [open-source release](https://github.com/stratomercata).

**If you have any questions or run into any issues during the transition, please [contact us](/contact/) in whatever way works best for you.  The [Telegram](https://t.me/stratomercata) channel will likely be the most responsive.**

Validator rewards and the CATA Points program will pause during the transition.
