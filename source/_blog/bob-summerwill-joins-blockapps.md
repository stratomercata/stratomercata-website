## Championing the STRATO Mercata Vision

> _"I am delighted to join BlocksApps and to contribute to the realization of the STRATO Mercata vision. Cryptocurrencies and stablecoins have found great product market fit, but bridging on-chain assets with the real world remains elusive. "Living on crypto" and "Unbank the banked" are not easy problems to solve, but they are essential for blockchain to achieve its ultimate utility. BlockApps are in a great position to deliver key building blocks for that end-goal."_

Bob's broad expertise and vision for the future of blockchain technology will be invaluable as BlockApps continues to drive innovation in the enterprise blockchain space.

## Pioneering Decentralized Governance for STRATO

Bob has strategically joined the BlockApps team in time for the expansion and intersection of offerings to the consumer market, particularly in the domains of Real World Assets (RWAs) and Decentralized Finance (DeFi). The company envisions a future where decisions governing the STRATO network are made through votes from distinguished individuals within the ecosystem, promoting a governance model that emphasizes transparency and community involvement. This initiative aims to set new standards for blockchain governance, ensuring that decision-making processes are both inclusive and accountable.

## Powering On-Chain Commerce and Real-World Assets

Looking ahead, BlockApps is driving a future where **commerce** is conducted entirely "on-chain." This shift toward a **permissionless**, unstoppable, and privacy-respecting system is facilitated by the **STRATO blockchain**. STRATO enables the creation of synthetic digital representations of **real-world assets**—including stackable gold and silver—that are **immutable** and **decentralized**, treating digital and physical assets with equal importance.

**Users can earn CATA governance tokens** for staking these real-world assets, further integrating physical goods into the **DeFi** ecosystem. STRATO will also function as a platform to vet and support sellers and developers committed to building tangible, real-world value—providing an extra layer of security and trust in the decentralized space.

Furthermore, STRATO will serve as a platform to vet and support sellers and developers within the ecosystem. The blockchain will provide open access to entities focused on building tangible, real-world value, further advancing the adoption and utility of decentralized technologies with an added layer of vetting that is needed in the industry.
