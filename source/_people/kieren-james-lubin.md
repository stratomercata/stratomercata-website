Kieren leads [BlockApps](https://blockapps.net) and [STRATO Mercata](https://stratomercata.com) as co-founder and CEO. He entered crypto in 2014 as an early Ethereum contributor, developing the project’s original Haskell client (which his team still uses) and participating in the early cryptocurrency research community.

After helping to pioneer enterprise blockchain deployments, he intentionally moved beyond that niche to build consumer-grade rails for tokenized real-world assets and DeFi.

Kieren grew up in New York City, attended [Stuyvesant High School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuyvesant_High_School), earned an A.B. in mathematics from [Princeton University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princeton_University) in 2011, and completed all-but-dissertation work in mathematical physics at [UC Berkeley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Berkeley). He is a co-founder and board alternate of the [Enterprise Ethereum Alliance](https://entethalliance.org) (2017–present).
