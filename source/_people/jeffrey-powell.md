Jeff Powell is a seasoned enterprise‐technology executive with a strong track record of shaping go‑to‑market strategies for emerging infrastructure platforms at the intersection of blockchain, tokenization, and real‑world assets. Across his career, Jeff has helped organizations modernize how they manage, trade and govern tangible and digital value through innovative technologies.

At [BlockApps](https://blockapps.net), Jeff plays a pivotal role in advancing the deployment and market positioning of [STRATO Mercata](https://stratomercata.com), a next‑generation Web3 asset infrastructure that enables the tokenization, staking, trading and redemption of physical and real‑world assets such as gold, silver, carbon offsets, collectibles and more. The platform offers fractionalized access to vault‑backed assets, smart‑contract enabled staking and credit opportunities, and transparent provenance and governance mechanisms. Under Jeff’s commercial leadership, [BlockApps](https://blockapps.net) has leveraged [STRATO Mercata](https://stratomercata.com) to democratize access to real‑world markets previously restricted to large players, while delivering enterprise‑grade blockchain scalability, identity verification and asset controls.

Prior to his tenure at [BlockApps](https://blockapps.net), Jeff served in a senior leadership role at [Diligent Corporation](https://www.diligent.com), a global leader in modern governance, risk and compliance software. There, he worked closely with corporate boards, C‑suite executives and compliance teams to align regulatory, technology and operational imperatives — enabling organizations to better govern, transparently manage risk, and adopt digital workflows across complex ecosystems.

Jeff blends strategic vision with hands‑on commercial execution: he excels at defining value propositions, forging strategic alliances, and leading cross‑functional teams to deliver measurable outcomes in fast‑moving, high‑impact settings. He is passionate about the future of digital ownership, market infrastructure and the role of blockchain in unlocking new asset classes, improving transparency and reshaping how value is exchanged globally — a mission squarely embodied in [STRATO Mercata](https://stratomercata.com)’s promise of "Where Stability Meets Opportunity."
