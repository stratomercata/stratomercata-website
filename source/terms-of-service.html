<p>Welcome! This Terms of Service Agreement (the "Agreement" or the "Terms") is between you and the company or other legal entity for which you are accepting this Agreement, and affiliates of that company or entity ("you" or "your" or "user") and STRATO Mercata, Inc., a BVI company registered under the number 2179057 ("STRATO Mercata", "we," "our," or "us"). This Agreement sets forth the terms and conditions that govern your access to, and use of, STRATO Mercata's websites including https://stratomercata.com, web applications, mobile applications, smart contracts, application protocol interfaces ("API"), decentralized applications, all other software that STRATO Mercata has developed for issuing, redeeming, tracking, and trading tokens and various assets and such other services, features, content, applications we offer (collectively referred to as the "STRATO Mercata Site", the "STRATO Mercata Services", "Services", "Interface", or "Wallet") (The STRATO Mercata Site, STRATO Mercata Services, Services, Interface, and Wallet shall be collectively referred to as "Products").</p>

<p>These Terms expressly cover your rights and obligations, and our disclaimers and limitations of legal liability, related to your use of and access to our Products. By accessing or using our Products, you accept and agree to be bound by and to comply with these Terms, including, without limitation, the binding arbitration provision and the class action waiver, both of which impact your rights as to how disputes are resolved. Our Products are only available to you, and you should only access them if you agree completely with this Agreement.</p>

<p>You understand and acknowledge that all our Products are non-custodial, meaning we never have custody, possession, or control of your digital assets at any time. When you deposit digital assets into an account in any smart contract initially developed by STRATO Mercata, you retain control over those digital assets at all times. The private key associated with the Ethereum address from which you transfer digital assets and/or the private key associated with the storage scalability service account you use is the only private key that can control the digital assets you transfer into these smart contracts. In some cases, you may withdraw digital assets from any smart contract initially developed by STRATO Mercata only to the Ethereum address from which you deposited the digital assets.</p>

<p>Our STRATO Mercata blockchain protocol is open sourced, is built on the Ethereum network, and allows users to store, interact with other protocols, compile/decompile call data, or trade certain compatible digital assets ("Protocol").</p>

<p>From time to time in the future we may offer additional products, and such additional products shall be considered a Product as used herein, regardless of whether such product is specifically defined in this Agreement.</p>

<p>We may make certain Products, including access to our APIs, data, and liquidity services, accessible or usable through interfaces, products or services provided by certain third-party partners, such as exchanges and trading platforms (each a "Third-Party Partners").</p>

<p>You agree that your use of the Products through an interface, product or service provided by one of our Third-Party Partners is nonetheless still subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.</p>

<h2>Modification to our Products</h2>

<p>STRATO Mercata may with or without notice to you discontinue, change, substitute, eliminate, or add to any product, service, or feature, in its sole discretion, at any time and modify, delete, filter, review, disable, and remove all information, content, and pricing from any of the Products. You agree that we may transfer you to a product or service that is reasonably similar to the discontinued or changed product or service, to the extent such product or service exists.</p>

<h2>Third-Party Services, Content, and Promotions</h2>

<p>Our Products may contain integrations, references, links or other access to third-party services, sites, technology, content and resources, including, but not limited to information, materials, products, or services (each a "Third-Party Service"). We have no control over these Third-Party Services, and in no event shall we be held responsible or liable for the accuracy, reliability, or contemporaneity of any third-party's services, content, or policies. Users who access or use a Third-Party Service through STRATO Mercata are subject to additional terms and conditions, privacy policies, or other agreements with such third-party, and you may be required to authenticate or create separate accounts to use Third-Party Services on the websites or via the technology platforms of these respective providers. You, and not STRATO Mercata are solely responsible for complying with the terms and policies of these third parties and will be responsible for all costs and charges associated with your use of any Third-Party Services. STRATO Mercata enables these Third-Party Services merely as a convenience and the integration or inclusion of such Third-Party Services does not imply an endorsement or recommendation. These third parties may offer promotions related to your access and use of our Products. We do not approve, monitor, endorse, warrant, or assume any responsibility for any such resources or promotions. Any dealings you have with third parties while using our Products are between you and the third-party, and STRATO Mercata will not be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with use of or reliance on any Third-Party Services.</p>

<p>Some Third-Party Services will provide us with access to certain information that you have provided to them, including through such Third-Party Services, and we will use, store and disclose such information in accordance with our Privacy Policy. For more information about the implications of activating Third-Party Services and our use, storage and disclosure of information related to you and your use of such Third-Party Services within our Products, please see our Privacy Policy. STRATO Mercata has no control over and is not responsible for such Third-Party Services, including for the accuracy, availability, reliability, or completeness of information shared by or available through Third-Party Services, or on the privacy practices of Third-Party Services. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of the third-parties providing Third-Party Services prior to using such services.</p>

<h2>Beta and Testnet</h2>

<p>From time to time, STRATO Mercata may make Beta services available to you. You may choose to try such Beta services or not in your sole discretion. Any use of Beta Services is subject to these Terms and any additional Beta services terms provided by STRATO Mercata at the time the Beta Services are made available.</p>

Any use of Testnet services is subject to these Terms and any additional Testnet services terms provided by STRATO Mercata at the time the Testnet is made available.</p>

<h2>Gas Fees</h2>

<p>Blockchain transactions require the payment of transaction fees to the appropriate networks ("Gas Fees"). Except as otherwise expressly set forth in the terms of another offer by STRATO Mercata, you will be solely responsible to pay the Gas Fees as well as all other fees for any transaction that you initiate via any of our Products. The value of the Gas Fee changes, often unpredictably, and is entirely outside of the control of STRATO Mercata. Although we attempt to provide accurate fee information, this information reflects our estimates of fees, which may vary from the actual fees paid to use the Products and interact with our blockchain. You acknowledge that under no circumstances will a transaction be invalidated, revocable, retractable, or otherwise unenforceable on the basis that the Gas Fee for the given transaction was unknown, too high, or otherwise unacceptable to you. You also acknowledge and agree that you cannot reverse, cancel, or change a transaction that has been marked as pending or complete, and that under all circumstances, the Gas Fee is non-refundable.</p>

<p>We reserve the right to refuse to process, or to cancel, correct, or reverse your transaction in response to a subpoena, court order, or other government order, or if we suspect that the transaction may involve money laundering, terrorist financing, fraud, or any other financial crime. STRATO Mercata is under no obligation to reinstate a transaction on the same terms as the cancelled, corrected, or reversed transaction.</p>

<p>SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES. THE FOREGOING DOES NOT AFFECT ANY LIABILITY THAT CANNOT BE EXCLUDED OR LIMITED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW.</p>

<h2>Assumption of Risk</h2>

<p>Use of our Products and the Protocol for trading digital assets, and issuing or acquiring digital tokens, may carry financial risk. Digital assets, by their nature, are highly experimental, risky, and volatile. Transactions entered into in connection with the Services are irreversible, final, and there are no refunds. You acknowledge and agree that you will access and use the Site and the Services at your own risk. Some of the risks you assume include, but are not limited to, the use of blockchain and cryptographic keys.</p>

<p><strong>Blockchain.</strong> By accessing and using any of our Products or interacting with our Site in any way, you represent that: (i) you are financially and technically sophisticated enough to understand the inherent risks associated with cryptographic systems and blockchain-based networks; and (ii) you have a working knowledge and understanding of the usage and intricacies of native digital assets such as ether (ETH), wrapped digital assets, stablecoins, smart contract-based tokens that follow the erc-20 standard, an Ethereum token standard, other systems that interact with blockchain-based networks, bridging, and Real World Assets ("RWAs") that may be found on the STRATO Mercata Site. You further acknowledge and accept the risk that: (i) the markets for digital assets are nascent and highly volatile due to risk factors including, but not limited to, speculation, adoption, security, technology, and regulation; (ii) anyone can create a token, including fake versions of existing tokens and tokens that falsely claim to represent projects and you may mistakenly trade those or other tokens; (iii) stablecoins may not be as stable as they purport to be nor fully or adequately collateralized and may be subject to panics and runs; (iv) blockchain based smart contract transactions automatically execute and settle and are irreversible when confirmed; (v) transacting with blockchain-based systems is variable and the cost and speed of use may increase dramatically at any time and may result in price fluctuations or increased costs when using the Services; (vi) the software underlying blockchain networks, including the Ethereum blockchain and the Protocol, are open source, such that anyone can use, copy, modify, and distribute it; and (vii) the underlying networks are subject to sudden changes in operating rules, such as those commonly referred to as "forks," which may materially affect the Services.</p>

<p>Although our intent is to provide you with accurate and timely information on the Site and during your use of the Services, the Site and other information available when using our Products may not always be entirely accurate, complete, or current and may also include technical inaccuracies or typographical errors. Information may be changed or updated from time to time without notice, including, without limitation, information regarding our policies. You acknowledge and agree that all decisions based on information contained on the Site or as part of the Services are your sole responsibility and that it is your responsibility to verify all information before relying on it. We make no representation as to the accuracy, completeness, or appropriateness for any particular purpose of any pricing information distributed via the Site or otherwise when using the Products. Prices and pricing information may be higher or lower than prices available on platforms providing similar services.</p>

<p>You understand that we do not create, own, or operate cross-chain bridges and we do not make any representation or warranty about the safety or soundness of any cross-chain bridge, including its use for STRATO Mercata governance.</p>

<p>You further understand that if you choose to act as a liquidity provider to the Protocol, that your digital assets may lose some or all of their value while they are supplied to the Protocol through the Site due to the fluctuation of prices of tokens in a liquidity pool or trading pair and we do not make any representation or warranty to the contrary.</p>

<p>You acknowledge that we are not responsible for any of these variables or risks, do not own or control the Protocol nor any of the underlying software through which the blockchain networks are formed, and cannot be held liable for any resulting losses that you experience while accessing or using any of our Products. Accordingly, you understand and agree to assume full responsibility for all risks resulting from your access and use of the Site to interact with the Protocol.</p>

<p>You also understand that no financial regulatory authority has reviewed or approved the use of STRATO Mercata's open-source blockchain Protocol and software and that the Products are not registered or licensed by any financial regulatory authority. You understand and acknowledge that we do not broker trading orders on your behalf. Nor do we facilitate the execution or settlement of your trades, which occur entirely on open-source public distributed blockchains. As a result, we cannot and do not guarantee market best pricing or best execution through our Products or when using our API/SDK, which routes trades across liquidity pools on many DEXes. Any references in a Product to "best price" does not constitute a representation or warranty about pricing available through such Product, on the Protocol, or elsewhere.</p>

<p><strong>Cryptographic Key.</strong> Blockchain networks use public/private key cryptography. As previously stated, you alone are responsible for securing your private key(s). We do not have access to your private key(s) and will not be able to retrieve or protect your digital assets; thus, you losing control of your private key(s) will permanently and irreversibly deny you access to digital assets on the Protocol, Ethereum blockchain, or any other blockchain-based network. This means that if you lose your private key(s), then you will not be able to transfer your digital assets to any other blockchain address or wallet and will be unable to realize any value or utility from the digital assets that you may hold.</p>

To the extent permitted by applicable law, you acknowledge and expressly agree to release, defend, indemnify, and hold us and the STRATO Mercata Parties harmless from and against all claims, damages, obligations, losses, penalties, actions, liabilities, judgments, costs or debt, and expenses (including but not limited to attorneys' fees), disbursements or any actions of any kind of injury (including death) arising out of or relating to: (i) your use of and access to any of our Products; (ii) your violation of any term of this Agreement and any STRATO Mercata Product Terms of Use; (iii) digital assets associated with your Ethereum address; (iv) your violation of any law, rule, or regulation, or right of any third-party; (v) any other party's access and use of any of our Products with your assistance or using any device or account that you own or control; (vi) any dispute between you and (a) any other user of any of the Products or (b) any of your own customers or users; (vii) any feedback or user content you provide to us concerning our Products; or (viii) your misappropriation or infringement of the rights of any other entity or person.</p>

<p>If you are obligated to indemnify any STRATO Mercata Party, we will provide notice to you of any such claim, suit, or proceeding. We or, at our discretion, the applicable STRATO Mercata Party, will have the right, at our sole discretion, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter which is subject to indemnification under this section, and you agree to cooperate with any reasonable requests assisting our defense of such matter. You may not settle or compromise any claim against any STRATO Mercata Party without our written consent.</p>

<p>Further, if any regulatory inquiry, legal action, litigation, dispute, or investigation related to you, your account or any related account arises (collectively referred to "Legal Action"), you agree to indemnify us for actual, reasonable legal costs and expenses directly related to the Legal Action, including attorney fees and costs.</p>

<h2>Governing Law</h2>

<p>No matter where you're located, the laws of the British Virgin Islands will govern this Agreement and these Terms and our relationship as if you entered into this Agreement in the British Virgin Islands, without regard to conflicts of laws rules. You further agree that each of our Products shall be deemed to be based solely in British Virgin Islands, and that although a product may be available in other jurisdictions, its availability does not give rise to general or specific personal jurisdiction in any forum outside the British Virgin Islands. The parties acknowledge that this Agreement evidences interstate commerce. If any provisions of this Agreement is inconsistent with any applicable law, those provisions will be superseded or modified only to the extent such provisions are inconsistent. You agree to submit to the courts of the British Virgin Islands for exclusive jurisdiction of any dispute arising out of or related to your use of the Products or your breach of these Terms. You waive any objection based on lack of personal jurisdiction, place of residence, improper venue, or forum non conveniens in any such action. Additionally, you agree that the British Virgin Islands are the proper forum for any appeals of an arbitration award or for court proceedings in the event that this Agreement's binding arbitration clause is found to be unenforceable.</p>

<h2>No Legal, Tax, Investment, or Financial Advice</h2>

<p>STRATO Mercata does not provide legal, tax, investment, or financial advice to you.</p>

<p>One or more of our Products may not be available or appropriate for use in your jurisdiction. By accessing or using any of our Products, you agree that you are solely and entirely responsible for compliance with all applicable laws and regulations that may apply to you. With regards to taxes, your use of our Products may result in various tax consequences, including, but not limited to, income or capital gains tax, value-added tax, goods and services tax, or sales tax. You are responsible for determining whether taxes apply to any transactions you initiate or receive and, if so, to report and/or remit the correct tax to the appropriate tax authority.</p>

<p>All information provided in connection with your access and use of the Site and the Services is for informational purposes only and should not be construed as investment advice or a recommendation that a particular token is a safe or sound investment. You are responsible for determining whether any investment, investment strategy or related transaction is appropriate for you based on your personal finances, objectives, and risk tolerance. The Terms are not intended to, and do not, create or impose any fiduciary duties on us. You are solely responsible for determining if you need to consult with qualified professionals in your own jurisdiction prior to using the Products, the Protocol, or determining whether a transaction on STRATO Mercata is appropriate for you and your objectives.</p>

<p>This Agreement is not intended to, and does not, create or impose any fiduciary duties on us. To the fullest extent permitted by law, you acknowledge and agree that we owe no fiduciary duties or liabilities to you or any other party, and that to the extent any such duties or liabilities may exist at law or in equity, those duties and liabilities are hereby irrevocably disclaimed, waived, and eliminated. You further agree that the only duties and obligations that we owe you are those set out expressly in this Agreement.</p>

<h2>Suspension, Termination, and Cancellation</h2>

<p>We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your access to use the Products without providing you with notice or reason. In the event of suspension, termination, and cancellations, your right to use the Services will immediately cease; however, your obligations under this Agreement will continue. We will not be liable for any losses suffered by you resulting from suspension, termination, or cancellation, for any reason, of your access to all or any portion of the Products.</p>

<p>Suspension will occur if we, in our sole discretion, suspect that you and/or your account is in violation of the provisions of this Agreement or applicable laws. Suspension shall also occur if we are: (i) required to do so by a regulatory authority, court order, facially valid subpoena, or binding order of a government authority; (ii) the account is, or is related to any account that is, subject to any pending litigation, investigation, or governmental proceeding; (iii) the account has a negative balance for any reason; (iv) we believe someone is attempting to gain unauthorized access to the account; (v) we believe there is unusual activity in the account; (vi) we believe your account was used to send or receive a ransomware payment; and (vii) the account is being accessed from a jurisdiction where we do not offer the use of our Products.</p>

<p>If your account has been suspended, you will be notified when accessing the Products. We may, in our sole discretion, give written notice that your account has been suspended and may, in our sole discretion, disclose the reasons for suspension, if permitted to do so by law.</p>

<h2>Rewards</h2>

<p>In connection with your historic or current use of one or more of our Products, we may provide you certain incentives, prizes or rewards for completing certain activities, such as staking your assets ("Rewards"). The criteria for earning a reward will be described within the applicable Product. Upon satisfaction of the criteria, to be determined exclusively by STRATO Mercata, for obtaining a reward and subject to your compliance with the associated rewards terms, this Agreement, and applicable law, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to promptly transfer the earned reward to the digital wallet that you designate or have connected to the applicable Product. We reserve the right to change, modify, discontinue or cancel any rewards programs (including the frequency and criteria for earning such Rewards), at any time and without notice to you.</p>

<h2>No Waiver</h2>

<p>Any right or remedy of STRATO Mercata set forth in this Agreement is in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other right or remedy whether described in these Terms, under applicable law, at law, or in equity. Our failure or delay in insisting upon or enforcing strict performance by you of any provision of this Agreement or exercising any right, power, or privileged under this Agreement shall not be construed as a waiver or relinquishment to any extent of our right to assert or rely upon any such provision or right in that or any other instance.</p>

<h2>Severability</h2>

<p>If it turns out that any part of this Agreement is invalid, void, or for any reason unenforceable, that term will be deemed severable and limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary to accomplish the objectives of the term to the greatest extent possible. The limitation or elimination of the term will not affect any other terms, all of which shall remain in full force and effect.</p>

<h2>Survival</h2>

<p>You understand and agree that all provisions of this Agreement, which by their nature extend beyond the termination or expiration of this Agreement, including, but not limited to, sections pertaining to suspension, cancellation, debts owed to STRATO Mercata, investigations, remedies for breach, termination, general use of the Products, disputes with STRATO Mercata, and general provisions, shall survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement.</p>

<h2>Notices</h2>

<p>You agree that we may provide notices to you under this Agreement using commercially reasonable means, including using public communication channels. Notices we provide using public communication channels will be effective upon posting.</p>

<h2>Limitation on Claims, Dispute Resolution, Arbitration & Waiver of Class Action and Jury Trial</h2>

<p>Any claim arising out of or related to these Terms or the Products must be brought to our attention within one (1) year from the date that such claim first arose; otherwise, this claim is permanently barred, which means that both you and STRATO Mercata will not have the right to assert the claim. If a potential dispute arises, you must contact us by sending an email to info@stratomercata.com so that we can attempt to resolve it without resorting to formal dispute resolution. We will use our best efforts to resolve any potential disputes through informal, good faith negotiations. If we are unable to reach an informal resolution within sixty days of your email, then you and we both agree to resolve the potential dispute according to the process set forth below.</p>

<p><strong>Agreement to Arbitrate.</strong> You agree and understand that any dispute, claim, disagreements arising out of or relating in any way to your access to or use of the Products, any communications you receive, any products sold or distributed through the Products, or the Agreement and prior versions of the Agreement (each a "Dispute") shall be resolved solely and exclusively by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that you and STRATO Mercata may seek equitable relief in court for infringement or other misuse of intellectual property. That means you cannot sue us in court or have a trial by jury. You agree to keep any arbitration proceedings, judgments, and awards, including, but not limited to, all information gathered, prepared, and presented for purposes of the arbitration or related to the dispute(s) therein, strictly confidential. The duty of confidentiality does not apply to the extent that disclosure is necessary to prepare for or conduct the arbitration hearing on the merits, in connection with a court application for a preliminary remedy or in connection with a judicial challenge to an arbitration award or its enforcement, or to the extent that disclosure is otherwise required by law or judicial decision.</p>

<p><strong>Format for Arbitration.</strong> The parties agree that: (i) any arbitration will occur in the British Virgin Islands unless you and we both agree to hold it elsewhere; and (ii) the arbitration will be conducted confidentially by a single arbitrator in accordance with the rules of JAMS in accordance with JAMS' Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures then in effect, in the English language, and with limited discovery.</p>

<p>If mutually agreed to, hearings may be conducted in person, by telephone, or remotely by way of video conference administered by JAMS and conducted in English and the arbitrator may provide for submitting and determining motions on briefs, without oral hearings. Other than class procedures and remedies discussed below, the arbitrator has the authority to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available to a court or other tribunal.</p>

<p><strong>Other Provisions.</strong> THE PREVAILING PARTY IN ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING TO ENFORCE THESE TERMS SHALL BE ENTITLED TO COSTS AND ATTORNEY'S FEES. THE ARBITRAL DECISION MAY BE ENFORCED IN ANY COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION.</p>

<p><strong>Jury Trial Waiver.</strong> You and STRATO Mercata hereby waive any constitutional and statutory rights to sue in court and have a trial in front of a judge or a jury. You and STRATO Mercata are instead electing that all disputes shall be resolved by arbitration as provided above. Court review of an arbitration award is subject to very limited review. Discovery may be limited in arbitration, and procedures are more streamlined than in court. If for any reason a claim by law or equity must proceed in court rather than in arbitration, you agree to waive any right to a jury trial and agree that any claim may be brought only in the British Virgin Islands.</p>

<p><strong>Waiver of Class Action.</strong> THE PARTIES WILL NOT COMMENCE AGAINST THE OTHER A CLASS ACTION, CLASS ARBITRATION, OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING. ALL DISPUTES AGAINST US BY YOU MUST BE BROUGHT IN YOUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR MEMBER OF ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION, OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.</p>

<h2>Force Majeure</h2>

<p>We shall not be held liable for any delays, failure in performance, or interruptions of service which result directly or indirectly from any cause or condition beyond our reasonable control, including but not limited to: any delay or failure due to any act of God, act of civil or military authorities, act of terrorism, civil disturbance, war, nuclear or natural disaster, epidemic, action or inaction of civil or military authorities, sabotage, strike or other labor dispute, fire, interruption in telecommunications or Internet services or network provider services, failure of equipment and/or software, other catastrophe, or any other occurrence which is beyond our reasonable control and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.</p>

<h2>Assignment</h2>

<p>You agree that we may assign any or all of our rights and/or transfer, sub-contract, or delegate any of our obligations under these Terms, without notice or obtaining your consent or approval. Your agreement to these Terms is personal to you and you may not transfer or assign it to any third-party without our express prior written consent, including by operation of law or in connection with any change of control. This Agreement shall be binding and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto, our successors, and permitted assigns.</p>

<h2>Relationship of Parties</h2>

<p>You agree and understand that nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to constitute, create, imply, give effect to, or otherwise recognize a partnership, employment, joint venture, or formal business entity of any kind, and the rights and obligations of the parties shall be limited to those expressly set forth herein.</p>

<h2>Entire Agreement</h2>

<p>This Agreement and the Privacy Policy, together with any product specific Terms of Use you enter into in connection with using a particular STRATO Mercata Product, sets forth the entire understanding and agreement as to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior discussions, agreements, and understandings of any kind (including without limitation any prior versions of this Agreement) and every nature between us.
